V1.0.4
Changelog
- !!!IMPORTANT UPDATE!!! After introducing the right click and then pressing on "Redownload Game Files", I broke the Add Game button and you will not be able to add your game
- Fix the Add game button not doing anything
- Optimization: Improve on game list caching, only new game will be written in the cache instead of writing whole 31k game everytime app is started.
- Optimization: Game list will update added/remove game list instantly instead of long load due to change above.
- Very sorry on this situation! I do better in future!
